<h2>What is Binary Search?</h2>
<p>
  Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value
  within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle
  element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target
  cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again
  taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this
  until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half
  being empty, the target is not in the array.

<h2>Binary Search in TypeScript</h2>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left &lt;= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] &lt; target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}

<p>Runs recursively, from the middle i</p>
<p>And there you&#39;ll find</p>
<p>[Verse]</p>
<p>If the target element is equal to the current, return the index</p>
<p>And if the target element is less than the current, search the left half</p>
<p>
  And if the target element is greater than the current, search the right half
</p>
<p>Until you find the target element, or return not found</p>
