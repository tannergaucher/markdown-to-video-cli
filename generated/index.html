<p>The writing had been on the wall for a long time, but this Friday it was literally on the wall.</p>
<h2>On Broadway Ave in South Williamsburg</h2>
<p>Back in October I spent 2 full days on the phone with the gas company. Ultimately, I made some good friends. Miss you, Dominick.</p>
<p>Anyways, as I was getting ready to hang up and call back to find a different person who might be willing to listen and help, the guy who I could tell I was speaking to me from deep in Jewish Brooklyn and whom knew that my current location was not New York City paused and asked if he could tell me something.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course&quot;, I replied, not skipping a beat.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what? I&#39;m jealous you&#39;re in REDACTED_PLACE. New York is really going downhill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like the downhill, I replied. It&#39;s easier to bike.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe my man at National Grid has a point.</p>
