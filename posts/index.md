# Hello World

This is my first markdown to video post!

Oh, joy!

We use text to speech to convert this post to an audio file.

Then we generate a transcript from the audio file.

Finally, we use the transcript to generate a video.

We generate the video by starting a chrome devtools session and taking a screenshot while animating the dom with the transcript text.

Then we stitch the screenshots together into a video.

Then we use ffmpeg to add the original audio to the video.

Pretty cool, huh?
